Close my eyes in the night
I'm doing fine
Things could all be worse
Talk blood spitting words
I'm allright
I'm doing fine
Things could all be worse

My loneliness get's me
My loneliness get's me through the night
My loneliness get's me
My loneliness get's me through the night
Loneliness get's me
My loneliness get's me through the night

I'm allright
I'm doing fine
Things could all be worse

'Cause

My loneliness get's me
My loneliness get's me through the night
My loneliness get's me
My loneliness get's me through the night
Loneliness get's me
My loneliness get's me through the night

Eyes shut, I'm still open
Let's not talk about me
Let's not talk about me

My loneliness get's me
My loneliness get's me through the night
My loneliness get's me
My loneliness get's me through the night
Loneliness get's me
My loneliness get's me through the night

An empty crossroad
Footprints in the sand
A silent witness
Of where we used to stand

A lonely morning
I feel so unsure
Life seems harder
Than it did the night before

I dance with loneliness
When the lights are low
When it's time to go
I don't wanna know
When the shadows rise
When I close my eyes
When it hurts inside
Tell me why

A weary mindtrip
And the night moves on
No more moonshine
Ever since you're gone

An endless torment
Waiting for your call
A hollow promise
That makes me feel so small

I dance with loneliness
When the lights are low
When it's time to go
I don't wanna know
When the shadows rise
When I close my eyes
When it hurts inside
Tell me why

Oh tell me why
Why does it hurt inside
When I just close my eyes
I see the shadows rise

Why
Why does it hurt inside
When I just close my eyes
I see the shadows rise

I dance with loneliness
When the lights are low
When it's time to go
I don't wanna know
When the shadows rise
When I close my eyes
When it hurts inside
Tell me why
Why does it hurt inside
When I just close my eyes
I see the shadows rise

Oh tell me why
Why does it hurt inside
When I just close my eyes
I see the shadows rise

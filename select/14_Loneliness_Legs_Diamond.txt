For all the miles we've traveled
Through distance and through time
We find the things we valued
They aren't worth one dime

We miss those who have left us
But they never really go away
They come to us in our dreams
If only they could stay

We've all been down that road before Loneliness
Can't take this feelin' any more
Loneliness

V2
I've lost a friend or two now
I've seen the seasons change
My heart is beating stronger
But still I can't explain

Loneliness is the feeling
I get when you're away
Loneliness it's just loneliness
If only you could stay

V3
I see it all so clearly
Like through a crystal ball
I dream we're still together
But you're not here at all

Ooooh – Loneliness
Ooooh – Loneliness

– Out
